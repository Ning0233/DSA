Both classes are sufficient to implement the functionality of a queue; however, there are differences between them.

When using a linked list for a queue, both enqueue and dequeue operations are very efficient at O(1). However, for a Python list, dequeue is O(n) because, while append is amortized O(1), accessing and removing the first element requires shifting all other elements.

A linked list is very efficient in terms of space, while resizing a Python list requires more memory each time it is resized. A linked list does not allow direct access to an index (unless you implement an additional function), while a Python list does.

In terms of implementation, a Python list is easier to code.
